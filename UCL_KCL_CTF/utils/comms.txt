I arrived earlier today. The journey took longer than expected, but everything was organised surprisingly well.

[???]
Is it busy already?

[???]
Very. I didn’t realise quite how many people would be here at once.

[???]
That doesn’t surprise me. This time of year is always like that.

[???]
There’s a large religious site near where I’m staying. I walked past it this afternoon and it was packed.

[???]
Yes, that’s the main reason people come there.

[???]
I felt a bit out of place at first. So many groups, guides, and volunteers everywhere.

[???]
How are you managing with the language?

[???]
French mostly. English works sometimes, but not with everyone.

[???]
Are you staying long?

[???]
Just a few days. Most people seem to be passing through rather than living here.

[???]
Will you visit your uncle while you’re nearby?

[???]
He lives about an hour away, closer to the mountains.

[???]
You’re not going hiking?

[???]
No, not really. I can already see them from here anyway.

[???]
At least transport is easy.

[???]
Yes, trains and buses seem set up specifically for visitors. I should head back now — I’ll message you later.
